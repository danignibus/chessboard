Implemented Features:

1. The board: a diffuse planar square with an 8x8 checkerboard pattern. Materials of adjacent squares must be recognisibly different, but not necessarily white and black (use procedural texturing).	[15 pts]
2. Pawns: composed of a cone and a sphere at the minimum (but feel free to go artistic), made of plastic (use diffuse + Phong-Blinn BRDF). [15 pts]


Things to go for:
Multi-bite: implement Quadric surfaces clipped by not one, but at least three clippers. Use it to e.g. give a fancy crown to the queen. [10 pts]
Bishops: built from clipped quadrics. Ideally reflective gold and/or silver with procedural normal mapping. Use the gradient of some procedural noise function to perturb the normals, giving the surface a dented, wavy, or bumpy appearance. [15 pts]
Queen: built from clipped quadrics that must include a hyperboloid for a slender waist. Ideally reflective, made of gold and/or silver. [15 pts]
Knights: built from clipped quadrics. Made of plastic (diffuse + Phong BRDF), with procedural normal mapping. Use the gradient of some procedural noise function to perturb the normals, giving the surface a dented, wavy, or bumpy appearance. [15 pts]
